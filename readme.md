# Delegate and Defer.scpt

### by Jered Benoit of [jeredb.com](http://jeredb.com)

## About the Script

This script was born out tweets related to the scriptability of the Sparrow email client. For original information: [http://jeredb.com/omnifocus-delegation](http://jeredb.com/omnifocus-delegation).

The script should create delegated and waiting tasks based of the original, and then compose an email with links that will allow the recipient to add the task to their OmniFocus, as well as allow the sender to go to the delegated and deferred task. This is a weird stop gap between where OmniFocus is, as an individual personal productivity application and a group task management tool. Use it wisely.

## Using The Script

This script requires [OmniFocus 2 Pro edition](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/).

This script should be added to the OmniFocus scripts folder, which can be accessed after launching OmniFocus and clicking `Help` > `Open Scripts Folder`. Then this script can be added to the OmniFocus toolbar. Right click on the OmniFocus toolbar and select `Customize Toolbarâ€¦` and then drag the Delegate and Defer script icon into the toolbar, then click `Done`. The Delegate and Defer icon can be clicked to activate it.

## Where things can go sideways

- You must have the Pro version of OmniFocus 2
- You must select a single task
- You must select a task that is not complete
- You must select a task that is not in the inbox
- You must select a task, not a project
- You must have the context that are used as variables in your OmniFocus
- You must defer tasks by whole days
- You must use Mail.app for email

If you don't follow the above, I can't guarantee that you will not have data loss, or that it will even work. I have tried to catch as many issues as I possibly can, but I am not perfect.
